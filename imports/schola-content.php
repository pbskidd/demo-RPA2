            <p>The Schola program at Regina Pacis Academy is predicated on the conviction that any person, no matter how old, can learn 
            to sing. Singing is an integral part of our Catholic liturgical life (“bis orat qui bene cantat,” in the famous Augustinian 
            maxim), and the formation of young people both in the discipline of an ensemble and the sensitivity to beauty which it 
            engenders is an important element in their formation. A prayerful atmosphere in rehearsal – bearing in mind that we “pray 
            twice” not only when we sing at Mass or the Office, but also any time we sing in preparation therefor – is a central tenet 
            of the program.

            <p>Students are assigned to a section based on a number of factors, including attentiveness in rehearsal and voice type.</p><p>Students, especially those in upper grades, are given written work in addition to their rehearsals, in order to solidify their study of various topics including the liturgical year, the structure of the Mass and Office, the names and interpretation of the chant neumes, and a broad overview of the history of music in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.</p>
