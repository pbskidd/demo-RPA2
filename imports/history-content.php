            <p>The grammar school is dedicated to the Immaculate Heart of Mary under her title of Regina Pacis, Queen of Peace. Our Blessed Mother, through 
            whom all graces are received, offers peace to all who struggle to imitate her Son, Our Lord Jesus Christ. Peace is the result of a well fought battle 
            and rests with the pure of heart.</p>
            <p>On the emblem, the crown of the Queen of Peace hovers over the flood waters with the olive branch, a symbol of peace, on each side. Small anchors 
            can be seen within the crown. They are symbols chosen for our mother school, Anchor Academy, and symbols for Spes Nostra, Our Hope. Surrounding the crown 
            are the words Our Lord spoke to his apostles the night before He died, “Pacem relinquo vobis, Pacem meam do vobis.” “Peace I leave with you, My peace I 
            give unto you.” It is in embracing the Cross that we find peace.</p>
