        <p><strong class="text-info">Classical Curriculum</strong><br />

        <p>This approach is suited to basic human nature and development and has been tested over
            centuries. Its purpose is not to teach the student everything, but instead to form in the
            student the ability to learn new material. Instead of teaching what to think, students are
            taught how to think. It is a rigorous education and requires self discipline. It trains students to be analytical, to be able to draw conclusions and it  fosters a love of learning.</p><br />

        <p>The classical educational approach is language-based, instead of image-based. The study of Latin
            and Greek support the study of language. Latin is the language of the Church, the root language
            of English and the language used by minds educated in the classics throughout the history of Western
            Civilization. It serves to train the mind in a clear and logical manner.</p><br />

        <p>A classical curriculum is history-intensive â€“ many subjects are studied within the context of history
            which is divided into four periods (the ancients, the medieval period through the early Renaissance,
            the late Renaissance through the early modern era, and modern times).</p><br />
