        <p>The school library at Regina Pacis Academy houses upwards of 3000 books.  We have a beautiful selection of carefully selected books based on various criteria important to a Classical Catholic school. Those criteria may include books that are: well written, have meaningful lessons, classics, beautifully illustrated and help the students to grow in their faith. Our book selections include: fiction, non-fiction, history, geography, science, art, music, poetry, classics, theology, picture books, leveled readers, resource, and special sections for Advent/Christmas and Easter.</p><br>

        <p>Students at Regina Pacis may check out books every week in an effort to encourage and foster a love of reading.  Parent volunteers run the school library Monday- Thursday at the end of the school day.  A visit to the school library is both an important and fun part of each studentâ€™s week here at Regina Pacis Academy!</p>
