            <p>Art is a major language of childhood and a compelling expression of who a child is and how they view the world they live in. The goal of our art program is to provide an experience that allows the child to develop their individual, unique language in the context of solid skill, techniques, projects and art history. The third and fourth grade students embark on a two-year cycle of art appreciation, travelling through time and exploring the artistic styles, images and themes of different cultures throughout history. The students learn the proper use and techniques of various art mediums and tools through painting, drawing, collage sculpture and more.</p>
