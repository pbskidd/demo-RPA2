        enrolling 5 or more children will only be required to pay for the first four. Tuition is paid in either monthly or 
        semiannual installments.</p>
        <p>Additional registration book fee of $225 (per student) is required per year.</p>
        
        <p><strong class="text-info"><em>Financial Aid</em></strong></p>
        <p>While the school’s mission is to keep tuition affordable, some families have legitimate financial difficulties at times. 
        Parents requesting financial aid are instructed by the Business Manager to fill out an online form from Student and School 
        Services, a division of National Association of Independent Schools. This organization makes an aid recommendation and submits 
        it to the school. The board’s financial aid committee considers this recommendation as well as the applicant’s most recent tax 
        return and other applicable circumstances in making its determination as to whether or not to grant or deny aid.</p>
