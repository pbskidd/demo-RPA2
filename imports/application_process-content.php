        <p><strong class="text-info"><em>Financial Aid</em></strong></p>
        <!-- <p>While the school’s mission is to keep tuition affordable, some families have legitimate financial difficulties at times. 
        Parents requesting financial aid are instructed by the Business Manager to fill out an online form from Student and School 
        Services, a division of National Association of Independent Schools. This organization makes an aid recommendation and submits it to the school. The board’s financial aid committee considers this recommendation as well as the applicant’s most recent tax return and other applicable circumstances in making its determination as to whether or not to grant or deny aid.</p> -->
		<p>The school’s mission is to keep tuition affordable. Financial aid is available to families who qualify.</p>
		
        <p><strong class="text-info"><em>Non-Discrimination Policy</em></strong></p>
        <p>Regina Pacis Academy admits students of any race, color, national origin and ethnic origin to all the rights, privileges, 
        programs, and activities generally accorded or made available to students at the school. It does not discriminate on the basis 
        of race, color, national origin or ethnic origin in administration of its educational policies, admission policies, scholarship 
        programs, and athletic and other school-administered programs.</p>

        <p><strong class="text-info"><em>Admission of Non-Catholic Students</em></strong></p>
		<p>The curriculum and student life at the Regina 
        Pacis and Cardinal Newman Academies are designed primarily for the children of Roman Catholic parents. The entire curriculum is 
        permeated with Catholic philosophy. Prayer and daily Catholic devotions are an integral part of the school day. However, students 
        who are not Catholic may be admitted to the school with the explicit understanding that all students must participate in all activities 
        in the school including classes in Religion and Theology.</p>
