        <p>Presentation is important as students are representing themselves, their family and their school. Taking pride in one’s appearance 
        is an important virtue. It demonstrates self-respect and respect for those with whom you come in contact. As dress and appearance reflect 
        attitudes, students should dress modestly and in good taste. Students should be neat, clean, well groomed and in proper uniform at all 
        times while at school or school- related functions. All students are expected to abide by the following dress code and rules:</p>
