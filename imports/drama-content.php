        <p>The primary purpose of the theater program is to teach the students to see their acting abilities as a gift from God, which they can use to enrich the lives of others. In order to give the best gift possible, the students put a great amount of work into every production.</p>

        <p>All students audition and receive roles, memorize lines, and learn to bring their characters to life. They are instructed in the basics of projection and enunciation, and are taught how to move and behave onstage. Students learn to present themselves with confidence, and many also learn a sense of humor about themselves, as theater requires even the meekest students to sometimes take center stage. </p><br />

        <p>The K-4th grades perform in the Christmas play each year, accompanied by the older students who sing in the Schola. The 5th-8th graders put on a full-length play each spring. Past productions include <em>Martin the Cobbler, Robin Hood</em>and <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream.</em></p><br />
