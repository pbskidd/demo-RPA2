                <br> <br>
                <p>We entrust our school to our Blessed Mother under the title of Sancta Maria,
                    Spes Nostra or "Holy Mary, Our Hope." </p>
                <p>The proven pedagogy of the Catholic Church conveys to young minds and hearts the truth,
                    goodness and beauty of the "permanent things." It imparts knowledge, to be sure, and more
                    importantly, wisdom, but in all fields of learning, it emphasizes the training of the mind to
                    recognize truth for its own sake. Our students learn how to think, which requires self-discipline,
                    so that they can analyze and draw useful conclusions. This method fosters wonder, a love of learning,
                    and a reverence for the nature of things.</p>
                <p>Regina Pacis Academy's classical curriculum is directed to the formation of the whole person - spiritually,
                    intellectually, morally, socially and physically - so that as our students mature, they will use their
                    freedom for God's glory and the salvation of their souls. For this, the deepening of the theological
                    and cardinal virtues is indispensable because the virtues are the powers that bring health to the soul
                    so that we can think clearly and choose rightly....and in accord with Jesus's words: "Seek first the
                    Kingdom of God." (Mt 6:33)</p>
