        <p>Tuition for the academic year is $5,000 per student. There is a tuition reduction for
            each additional child from the same family.  Our tuition policy is as follows: $5,000 for the first child, $8,500 for two children, $9,500 for three children, $10,000 for more than three children and a cap at this fee for additional children. Families enrolling more than four children receive full tuition scholarships for the fifth child on. Additional scholarships are available on a case by case basis.</p>
