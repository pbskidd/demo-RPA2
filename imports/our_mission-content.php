        <p><strong class="text-info"><em>Regina Pacis Academy and Cardinal Newman Academy </em></strong>
            offer students their patrimony in the Catholic Faith within a classical education. Students learn to do all
            things well, aware that they act in the presence of their heavenly Father. Our teachers demonstrate their witness
            to the Faith, their dedication to education and their affection for their pupils.The reception of the Sacraments
            sustains the life of the school. We believe this education should be affordable for all those who seek it..</p><br />

        <p><strong class="text-info"><em>Our Goal</em></strong> is an integrated life with Jesus Christ at the center, which will
            ensure that all natural gifts and interests are ordered properly. We seek to impart a philosophy of life, as much as
            intellectual formation. Only through the Cross can the Christian heart be purified and the joy for which it longs be
            fulfilled. This is the "narrow path" Jesus proposed to us by precept and example.</p><br />
